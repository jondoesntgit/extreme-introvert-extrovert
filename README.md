# Extreme Introvert/Extrovert simulation

Suppose you have a collection of extreme extroverts (want all possible social interactions) and extreme introverts (want zero social interactions). 
At every timestep, 

- each extrovert seeks out somebody with whom he does not have a relationship and creates one.
- each introvert seeks out somebody with whom he has a relationship and destroys it.

With slight imbalances in the extrovert-introvert ratio, the equilibrium % of possible relationships varies wildly.

(Note, relationships between extroverts are ignored, because they clutter up the graph and there can be a lot of them)
